# Improvement Proposals for the Interactive SVAR Website

These suggestions are derived from a close reading of *paper.md* together with the quick-reference summary in `tmp_paper_summary.md`.  They are organised by website section so you can implement them incrementally.  Each bullet states **what to change** and **why it matters** relative to the research paper.

---

## Section Zero (Intro – `index.html` placeholder)
1. **Connect to Paper Abstract** – Add a short paragraph that mirrors the *Abstract* focus on "shrinking towards valid restrictions and relaxing invalid ones as the sample grows" to frame the demo’s purpose.
 
 

## Section Two (Recursive Estimator – `section_two.js`) 
2. **Explain Identification Failure** – Add a short paragraph referencing *paper* “infinitely many B(φ)” to stress that uncorrelatedness alone is insufficient. 

## Section Three (Non-Gaussian Estimator – `section_three.js`) 
2. **Add Kurtosis Toggle** – Insert an info-callout to explain and reference to the mean independence identificatoin result from the paper
4. **Explain Mean-Independence** – Insert an info-callout comparing uncorrelated vs mean-independent using the “demand vs supply” example from the paper.

## Section Four (Ridge Estimator – `section_four.js`)
