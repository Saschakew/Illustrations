            <p>We first generate two raw shock series. The first, \(\eta_{1t}\), is drawn from a standard Normal distribution. The
                second, \(\eta_{2t}\), is from a mixture of two Normal distributions, designed to be non-Gaussian.The raw shocks
                \(\eta_{t}\) are scaled by a time-varying volatility process \(\sigma_t\). For the first half of the sample,
                \(\sigma_t = 1\), and for the second half, \(\sigma_t = 2\). This produces structural shocks \(\epsilon_t = \sigma_t
                \eta_{t}\). We normalize the shocks to zero mean and unit variance. The reduced-form shocks \(u_t\) are equal to
                \(u_t = B_0 \epsilon_t\). </p>
            <p class="model-explanation">We consider two different SVAR models: A recursive model with \(B_0^{\text{rec}} =
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0.5 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\) and a non-recursive model with \(B_0^{\text{non-rec}} =
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\ 0.5 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Use the \(B_0\) switch to toggle between the two models. </p>

                <li><strong>Left Plot (Structural Shocks):</strong> Displays a scatter plot of \(\epsilon_{1t}\) against
                    \(\epsilon_{2t}\). Observe the non-Gaussian features from \(\epsilon_{2t}\).</li>
                <li><strong>Right Plot (Reduced-Form Shocks):</strong> Displays a scatter plot of \(u_{1t}\) against \(u_{2t}\).
                    These are the shocks as they would be observed in a reduced-form VAR model. Notice how their distribution
                    changes when you toggle \(B_0\), illustrating how different mixtures of the structural shocks \(\epsilon_t\)
                    can produce different patterns in the observed reduced-form residuals.</li>
