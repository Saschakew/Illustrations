    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This page visualizes different methods for identifying structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models.</p>
    <p>An example of LaTeX: $E = mc^2$</p>
    <p>We will explore how to use economic theory or statistical properties to impose restrictions on the contemporaneous relationships between variables, allowing us to uncover the underlying structural shocks.</p>
